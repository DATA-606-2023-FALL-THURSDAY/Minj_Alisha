## Background

The digital landscape, though filled with opportunities, is riddled with threats that pose significant challenges to individual and institutional security. One such prevalent threat is phishing. Phishing websites, designed to deceive and extract confidential information from unsuspecting users, leverage the trust that is typically associated with legitimate domains. As the vastness and complexity of the internet grow, manual detection and mitigation of such threats become increasingly untenable. This project, "PhishGuard", endeavors to bridge this gap by employing URL and DNS features to robustly detect and classify domains based on their potential malicious intent.

The creation and deployment of an effective detection model holds paramount importance in today's digital age. It extends benefits not only to individual users but also to businesses, organizations, and governments. By proactively identifying and classifying potential threats, we can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and other security compromises, fostering a safer digital environment for all.
