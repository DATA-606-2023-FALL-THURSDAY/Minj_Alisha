## **Background**

Electricity serves as the backbone of modern societies, driving economies and enabling technological advancements. Its consumption patterns provide insights into a region's growth, technological adoption, and socio-economic dynamics. This study focuses on Maryland, a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US, known for its diverse landscapes and economic activities ranging from industrial manufacturing to agriculture.

**What is it about?**
This analysis aims to dissect the electricity consumption in Maryland over a 12-year period from 2010 to 2022. Specifically, we will explore various metrics like electricity sales, revenues, and prices across different sectors such as residential, commercial, and industrial.

**Why does it matter?**
Understanding electricity consumption patterns is crucial for several reasons:
1. **Economic Indicators:** Electricity consumption often parallels economic activity. A rise in industrial electricity demand might indicate an upswing in manufacturing and production activities.
2. **Policy Implications:** Insights from consumption patterns can guide state policymakers in framing energy policies, infrastructure development, and sustainability initiatives.
3. **Future Forecasting:** Analyzing past trends helps utility companies and state planners in predicting future demand, ensuring the state's energy needs are met without compromising on sustainability or causing undue strain on resources.

**Research Questions:**
Given the scope of the analysis, our primary research questions are:
1. How has electricity consumption in Maryland evolved over the 12-year period across different sectors?
2. What are the driving factors behind the observed trends in sales, revenue, and prices?
3. Are there discernible seasonal patterns in electricity consumption, and if so, what might be causing them?
4. How does the electricity consumption in Maryland compare with national averages or with neighboring states?

**Target for ML Model**: `RESIDENTIAL_Sales`  

**Potential Predictors**:
- **Year and Month**: Time variables can capture temporal patterns and seasonality in the data.
- **State**: Different states might have distinct consumption patterns.
- **RESIDENTIAL_Revenue & RESIDENTIAL_Price**: To understand how sales correspond to revenue and price changes in the residential sector.
- **COMMERCIAL_Sales & INDUSTRIAL_Sales**: Consumption in other sectors can indirectly affect or reflect residential consumption trends.
- **TOTAL_Revenue & TOTAL_Price**: A macro perspective, understanding overall revenue and price dynamics can be predictive.2.
