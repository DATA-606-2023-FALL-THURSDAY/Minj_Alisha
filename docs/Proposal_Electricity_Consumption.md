## Background

Electricity consumption and its associated metrics such as sales, revenue, and prices have always been an integral part of evaluating a region's development and energy needs. Understanding the dynamics of these factors helps policymakers, businesses, and consumers make informed decisions.

- **What is it about?**  
  This analysis explores the electricity consumption trends in terms of sales, revenue, and prices.

- **Why does it matter?**  
  Proper analysis can lead to improved energy policy decisions, smarter business investments, and increased awareness about energy consumption patterns among consumers.

- **Research Questions**:
  1. How has the electricity consumption pattern changed from 2010 to 2023?
  2. Which states have seen the most significant changes in their consumption patterns?
  3. How do sales correlate with revenue and prices?

**Target for ML Model**: `RESIDENTIAL_Sales`  

**Potential Predictors**:
- **Year and Month**: Time variables can capture temporal patterns and seasonality in the data.
- **State**: Different states might have distinct consumption patterns.
- **RESIDENTIAL_Revenue & RESIDENTIAL_Price**: To understand how sales correspond to revenue and price changes in the residential sector.
- **COMMERCIAL_Sales & INDUSTRIAL_Sales**: Consumption in other sectors can indirectly affect or reflect residential consumption trends.
- **TOTAL_Revenue & TOTAL_Price**: A macro perspective, understanding overall revenue and price dynamics can be predictive.
- **Data Status**: Can be used to weigh recent observations differently since they're preliminary.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A comprehensive EDA will be performed focusing on:
- Summary statistics of key variables.
- Visualizations showcasing the trend and distribution of the target variable and predictors.
- Data cleansing activities to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Transformation and feature engineering, if necessary.


## Model Training

- **Models to be used**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and ARIMA models.
- **Training Strategy**: Data will be split into an 80/20 train-test split.
- **Packages**: Primarily `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, and ARIMA.
- **Environment**: Local development, with potential to extend to Google CoLab.
- **Performance Metrics**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared value.


## Application of the Trained Models

A web application will be developed to allow users to:
- Input their state and month-year to get predictions on electricity sales.
- View historical trends and metrics.
- Developed using **Streamlit** due to its simplicity and integration capabilities.
